					<div class="faqsQ">Are you a Writer?</div>
					<p class="faqsAns">You are writing a short ebook. As part of your research, you surf the web and add relevant content, images, and videos to your Shareist Notebook. You edit your pages by adding your own copy and images, customize and categorize. When you’re finished, Shareist makes it easy to turn it into a great looking eBook.</p>

					<p class="faqsAns">Coming up with new ideas can be challenging. Shareist helps you capture ideas when you have them and inspiring posts from the web when you see them. The Shareist Content Stream helps you keep your eye on the latest news, videos, tweets on your subject. Work on your posts in private, and when they’re ready, publish them on your Notebook or export them to your Wordpress blog.</p>
